# Unit2.PartyPlanner

Block 21 Workshop: Party Planner

Notes:

1. When using 2407-FTB-ET-WEB-FT as the cohort for the API URL, party information will not populate and will only input "F" in all of the sections.

2. Using 2109-CPU-RM-WEB-PT as the cohort for the API URL seems to work, although I am unsure why.
